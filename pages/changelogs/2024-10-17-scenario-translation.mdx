With the new **Scenario Translation** feature, users can effortlessly translate their surveys from the default language to any language available in their workspace with just a single click.

This enhancement streamlines the process of creating multilingual surveys, ensuring that your audience can engage with your content in their preferred language, thereby improving accessibility and user experience.

To translate a survey, follow these steps:

- A panel should open. From here, select the target language you want.
- When you are done, click on the **Translate** button at then very bottom of the panel.
- Wait for the translation to be done. It should only take some seconds.
- Read the translated result and arrange the wording like you want.
