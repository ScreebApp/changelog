We are exited to annouce our new feature **Weekly Briefing**. This feature will allow you to receive a weekly summary of your workspace activity directly in your inbox.
You can also add external recipients to the briefing.

Each Weekly Briefing is highly customized to your role in the company. Metrics like
Funnels, Surveys, Messages, Sessions, and more are included in the report.

Finally, a list of Next actions is provided to help you improve your workspace performance.

This will help you to keep track of your workspace performance and make data-driven decisions for your specific role in your company.

You can setup your Weekly Briefing [Here](https://admin.screeb.app/org/last/weekly-briefs).
